# Terminal

This project is a basic JavaScript "Terminal," designed as a fun way to explore and learn more about JavaScript. It provides multiple simple commands, emulating terminal-like functionality within a browser.

## Features

The terminal supports the following commands:

- **about**: Displays information about the terminal.
- **help**: Lists all available commands.
- **echo**: Prints the provided arguments to the output.
- **clear**: Clears the console output.
- **open**: Opens a provided link in a new tab.
- **alert**: Displays an alert dialog with the provided arguments.
- **color**: Changes the background color of the page to the specified color.
- **triangle**: Prints a `*` triangle of the specified size to the console.
- **cos**: Calculates and displays the cosine of the provided number.
- **rename**: Renames the current user.
- **add (+)**, **sub (-)**, **mul (*)**, **div (/)**: Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers.

## Getting Started

To use the terminal, simply open the HTML file in your browser and interact with the terminal interface by typing commands. This project is purely for educational purposes and allows users to see how JavaScript can be used to create interactive web-based applications.

## How to Use Commands

1. **about**: Type `about` and press Enter to learn about this terminal.
2. **help**: Type `help` to get a list of all commands and their descriptions.
3. **echo [text]**: Type `echo` followed by any text to see it printed.
4. **clear**: Use `clear` to reset the terminal output.
5. **open [URL]**: Type `open` and provide a URL to open it in a new tab. Example: `open https://example.com`.
6. **alert [message]**: Use `alert` followed by a message to display it in an alert box.
7. **color [color name or HEX code]**: Change the page's background color. Example: `color blue` or `color #ff5733`.
8. **triangle [size]**: Type `triangle` followed by a number to print a triangle with that many rows.
9. **cos [number]**: Calculate the cosine of a number. Example: `cos 45`.
10. **rename [new name]**: Change the current user's name. Example: `rename Alex`.
11. **add [num1] [num2]**: Perform addition. Example: `add 5 3`.
12. **sub [num1] [num2]**: Perform subtraction. Example: `sub 10 4`.
13. **mul [num1] [num2]**: Perform multiplication. Example: `mul 7 6`.
14. **div [num1] [num2]**: Perform division. Example: `div 8 2`.

## Additional Notes

- The terminal is case-insensitive; commands can be typed in lowercase as it is shown.
- This project was built to enhance JavaScript skills and is open for further extensions.

Enjoy experimenting with the terminal and expanding your JavaScript knowledge ;) !!!
